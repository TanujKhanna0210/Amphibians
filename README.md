# Amphibians
An app that displays information about different amphibian species.  
The app gets data from a _custom API_ and display it in a list view.
It uses the concepts of networking, JSON parsing, and view models to use data from the network.

The first screen the user will see displays the names of each species in a recycler view.
Tapping a list item navigates to the detail screen which also displays the species' name as well as a detailed description.
